title: Decision Tree Nodes, Discussing Tradeoffs

<p>I've only recently returned to the shogi AI project after realizing I now have the data structure know-how to get off the ground. But first, I had to design a struct to hold that data. Below is my original concept:</p>
<code>
struct tree_node{
       struct tree_node *parent;
       struct tree_node **children;
       int score;
       char board[9][9];
       char graveyard[2][38];
};
</code>
<p>
This way, the status of the game is preserved in every single node of the decision tree. However, I soon realized that this was extremely memory inefficient, and I only had to store the changes made to the game state, and use a stack to hold all the previous game states.
</p>
<code>
struct tree_node{
       struct tree_node *parent;
       struct tree_node **children;
       int score;
       char *delta;
};
</code>
<p>
Luckily, <sys/queue.h> already implemented stacks and their basic behaviours for me, so building the decision tree wasn't so difficult after all
