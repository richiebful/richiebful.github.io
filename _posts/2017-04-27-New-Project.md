title: Exams over, starting new project

Exams are over, and I'm reflecting back on the most taxing semester so far. But more importantly, I'm looking forward to the summer ahead. This summer, I'm working on a agro-informatics project. Map out your garden, use analytics to decide on a good crop rotation and companion crops, figure out where you need fertilizer and compost, etc. It will start very small, using a small body of crop choices and a small feature set, but it will grow as I have time and as I can onboard more contributors.
