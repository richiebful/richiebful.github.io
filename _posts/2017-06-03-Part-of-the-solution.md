If you're not Rip Van Winkel, I'm sure you know that steel is effectively dead in the Mongahela Valley. Braddock makes steel and Clairton makes coke (an ingredient for the production of steel), but they are exceptions in a once mill-heavy area. But even these towns are suffering. Braddock has suffered a 90% population drop since the 1920s. None of the Edgar Thompson Steel Mill's workers live there. Clairton has shed around two-thirds of its population. The remainder disproportionately suffers from asthma thanks to the Clairton Coke Works.

There's no doubt in my mind that these suburban former mill towns will have to endure even more population loss before they reach sustainable levels. However, there is also great opportunity to invest and build wealth in these suburban communities. One idea? Value-added agriculture. Obviously agriculture is not a solution to bring back these towns to their former glory. However, for the residents who remain, growing crops, processing them, and selling them is a way to put power back in people's hands. If a community can develop food security, and begin producing high-value products for local consumption, it is just one step closer to prosperity.

For example, whisky is rising in American culture. In a region (the Monongahela) that has long-standing historical ties to rye whisky, this is just one obvious product for the region to produce. Local farms can grow the rye. Towns can establish malthouses to feed distillers. Existing local distillers like Wigle can buy these products, or new distillers can set up shop in Mon towns. For rye, grain mills and bakeries are another use case. Cows and pigs can use rye stalks as feed, leading to dairy products and meat. In other words, Monongahela towns can develop an economy based on the products of the soil. With the federal and state governments strapped for cash, we can expect little investment. Ditto for big industry that made the region a steel-making, coal-burning behemoth.

I don't have all of the answers. As a newcomer to the banks of the Monongahela (a Pittsburgher, at that), I can only understand so much about the challenges facing Mon residents. But we need to open up a dialogue between governments, NGOs, and industry and residents so we can invest and begin the long process of right-sizing and revitalizing the region.
