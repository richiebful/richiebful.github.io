title: A disappearing act, the American middle class
category: policy

It's been in the headlines for years. The middle class in America is disappearing. The American dream is in freefall. The 1% is growing at the expense of the 99%. I'm not here to assuage your fears. But I am here to discuss a way out.

[In this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUnguEjTPDY) William Lazonick economics professor at UMass-Lowell explains that the middle class has disappeared because American firms have adapted to globalization by shedding workers and downsizing instead of reinvesting in workers and making them more competitive vis-a-vis Japanese workers or Indian workers. Instead, they've poured their money into buying back their stock from investors, inflating their stock price. 

In the past decade, money poured into buybacks in the S&P500 has buypassed dividends (profits shared with stockholders). And incentive to keep buying back stock remains high. You see, capital gains are taxed at a discount from cash income, so CEOs and other major executives are often paid largely in stock. Then they make the easiest decision available. Minimize costs (cutting workers and investment) and plow profits into buybacks. Sell stock, and make an enormous profit.

Luckily for us, this has an easy solution: tax capital gains at the same rate as income. We did it back in the early 1900s without any economic disaster like the wealthy were predicting. People continued to invest money in the economy, and the wealthy continued to make money. And during the World Wars and Great Depression (when very high marginal tax rates hit the wealthy hard) it acted as a check on income inequality. And perhaps even more, the government should disincentivise gambling on commodities and forex markets and instead incentivize investment in low-growth but high-community value businesses that build wealth in our communities. In addition, companies should be incentivized to train workers through tax deductions for funding college degrees and accredited programs. This will add greatly to the wealth and well-being of our communities, and encourage long-term employment as opposed to the short stints that modern workers have grown accustomed to.
