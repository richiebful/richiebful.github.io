title: Getting your energy back

Ever wake up, have your morning breakfast (with necessary coffee) only to realize that, two hours later, you're tired and hungry again? Then you decide "Ah! let's have another cup of coffee!" or "A bagel would hit the spot right now." You become dependent on constant snacking to keep your energy and work productivity up. High levels of simple sugar and other carbs in your diet might be the problem.

I love me a nice stack of pancakes, with layers of jam or honey in between. Maple syrup is good and all, but nothing beats homemade blackcurrant jam or local buckwheat honey. On other, more rushed days, I might butter a hunk of Borodinsky bread and sprinkle some salt on. Lunch usually includes bread and salad or leftovers from dinner, but I get cookies from the cafe more often than I would like to say. Dinner is actually pretty healthy, I gotta say. This winter has been heavily reliant on cabbage, root vegetables, and pickled ingredients. Finally perfected my Russian cabbage soup recipe, and my red borscht is getting there. But the heavy reliance on carbohydrates (consequences of a poorly managed transition to veganism) and high levels of sugar (it's addictive as fuck) are responsible for me being a low-energy Jeb Bush.

So for the next 40ish days, until 1 June, I'll be giving up added sugar. Since I cook >95% of the meals I *think* this will be easy. The challenge is cutting out the desert and the occasional bagel I buy. For people more reliant on others' cooking, this is a lot harder. Restaurants and cafes rarely tell you if there's added sugar. Condiments often have added sugar. Baked goods almost always have added sugar. Same with store-bought breads, although I've baked several recipes without it (favorite being King Arthur's Sourdough Whole Wheat.) Local joints will often give you an ingredient list without issue.

But what to replace high-sugar, low-nutrition foods with? Fruits. Vegetables. Grains. Meats. Dairy. The bottom, more important part of the food pyramid. All of these are more nutritious, more filling, and more satisfying than obscene amounts of sugar. Eating sugar can make you feel sick sometimes. If you are like most people, eating more vegetables is probably the best replacement. If you already eat broccoli until it comes out your ears, protein. If you love baking and will miss your sugary deserts, replace that habit with baking bread instead. Make the next month sugar free. Join me, and we can up our quality of life.
